# Learning CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

Welcome to my **CS50 Python Learning Journey**! This repository is my personal workspace to document and share my progress as I work through the [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) curriculum. Here, I’ll be adding my solutions, code samples, and notes on each topic covered in the course.

## About This Course
CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python is a course offered by Harvard University. It covers essential programming concepts, Python syntax, and real-world problem-solving techniques. By the end of this course, I aim to have a solid foundation in Python and programming fundamentals, along with hands-on experience in building small projects and utilities.

### Curriculum
This course includes the following topics:
1. **Functions, Variables**: Introduction to Python functions, data types, variables, and scope.
2. **Conditionals**: Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to control the flow of code.
3. **Loops**: Writing `for` and `while` loops to iterate over sequences and perform repeated tasks.
4. **Exceptions**: Handling errors gracefully with `try` and `except`.
5. **Libraries**: Leveraging Python’s extensive standard library and importing external libraries.
6. **Unit Tests**: Writing and running tests to ensure code correctness.
7. **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
8. **Regular Expressions**: Using `re` to perform pattern matching on strings.
9. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating classes and objects, understanding inheritance and encapsulation.
10. **Et Cetera**: Other advanced topics, such as decorators and lambda functions.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a topic in the curriculum. Within each folder, you’ll find:
- **Code Examples**: Sample code demonstrating key concepts.
- **Problem Solutions**: Solutions to coding exercises and assignments.
- **Notes**: My personal notes, explanations, and observations.
